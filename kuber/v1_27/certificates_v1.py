    CertificateSigningRequest objects provide a mechanism to
    obtain x509 certificates by submitting a certificate signing
    request, and having it asynchronously approved and issued.

    Kubelets use this API to obtain:
     1. client certificates to authenticate to kube-apiserver
    (with the "kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client-kubelet"
    signerName).
     2. serving certificates for TLS endpoints kube-apiserver
    can connect to securely (with the "kubernetes.io/kubelet-
    serving" signerName).

    This API can be used to request client certificates to
    authenticate to kube-apiserver (with the
    "kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client" signerName), or to
    obtain certificates from custom non-Kubernetes signers.
